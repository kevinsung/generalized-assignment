    "In the generalized assignment problem, we are given a collection of $n$ jobs to be assigned to $m$ machines. Each job $j = 1, . . . , n$ is to be assigned to exactly one machine; if it is assigned to machine $i$, then it requires $p_{ij}$ time units of processing, and incurs a cost of $c_{ij}$.

It can be shown that all extreme points of the polytope are integral, and there is a way to convert the fractional solution into an optimal integral one within polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call all edges with weight in the range $(0,1)$ _unsaturated_ and $\\{0,1\\}$ _saturated_. We present an iterative method such that after one loop, the number of unsaturated edges decreases by at least $1$, and the sum of weights attached to a left vertex is preserved as $1$. Since at the end there is no unsaturated edge left and each left vertex is attached to edges with weights summing up to $1$, each left vertex is mapped to a right vertex via the unique edge with weight $1$. We will see shortly that this map is also injective, proving that it is a perfect matching on the left side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a cycle of unsaturated edges. Color them by blue and red alternately. By increasing the weights of all red edges by a small amount $\\delta$ and decreasing the weights of blue ones by $\\delta$, no LP constraints are violated provided that $\\delta$ is sufficiently small. As this works for both positive and negative $\\delta$s, the original optimal solution lies in the middle of a line segment on the polytope, and every  point on the line is optimal as well since the objective function is linear. We can thus move $\\delta$ towards the positive direction until one of the red edges comes to $1$ or one of the blue edges comes to $0$. Either way we decreased the number of unsaturated edges by at least $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Call a vertex _single_ if it is only attached to an unsaturated edge, then the weight on the vertex is easily seen as equal to the the weight of the edge. Note that no left vertex can be single since they all have weight exactly $1$. Suppose now there is no cycle of unsaturated edge left, then each maximum path of unsaturated edge must start and end at single vertices. Choose a maximum path and color the edges by blue and red alternatively. Similar to case 1, perturbing the weight of all blue and red edges by a small amount $\\delta$ does not violate any of the LP constraints, and we can freely move $\\delta$ until one red edge reaches $1$ or one blue edge reaches $0$. Preprocessing could be handy if we merge all single nodes as one beforehand, as this case would fall into case 1 as well."
