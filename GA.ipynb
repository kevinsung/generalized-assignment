    "In the generalized assignment problem, we are given a collection of $n$ jobs to be assigned to $m$ machines. Each job $j = 1, . . . , n$ is to be assigned to exactly one machine; if it is assigned to machine $i$, then it requires $p_{ij}$ time units of processing, and incurs a cost of $c_{ij}$. Furthermore, we are given a time bound $T$ that limits the total processing of each machine $i = 1, . . . , m$. The aim is to find a feasible assignment of minimum total cost.\n"

We present an iterative method such that after one loop, the number of unsaturated edges decreases by at least $1$, and the sum of weights attached to a left vertex is preserved as $1$. Since at the end there is no unsaturated edge left and each left vertex is attached to edges with weights summing up to $1$, each left vertex is mapped to a right vertex via the unique edge with weight $1$. We will see shortly that this map is also injective, proving that it is a perfect matching on the left side.\n",

By increasing the weights of all red edges by a small amount $\\delta$ and decreasing the weights of blue ones by $\\delta$, no LP constraints are violated provided that $\\delta$ is sufficiently small. As the objective function is linear in $\\delta$, there must be one direction where the objective value is not increased. We can thus move $\\delta$ towards that direction until one of the red edges comes to $1$ or one of the blue edges comes to $0$. Either way we decreased the number of unsaturated edges by at least $1$.\n",

Note that no left vertex can be single since they all have weight exactly $1$. Suppose now there is no cycle of unsaturated edge left, then each maximum path of unsaturated edge must start and end at single vertices. Choose a maximum path and color the edges by blue and red alternatively. Similar to case 1, perturbing the weight of all blue and red edges by a small amount $\\delta$ does not violate any of the LP constraints, and we can freely move $\\delta$ until one red edge reaches $1$ or one blue edge reaches $0$.
